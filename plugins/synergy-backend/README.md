# synergy

Welcome to the synergy backend plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/synergyPlugin/health](http://localhost:7007/api/synergyPlugin/health).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.

## Installation

Add the plugin to your backend app:

```bash
yarn workspace backend add  @jiteshy/backstage-plugin-synergy-backend
```

In your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` make the following changes:

```ts
import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
const backend = createBackend();
// ... other plugins
backend.add(import('@jiteshy/backstage-plugin-synergy-backend'));
backend.start();
```
